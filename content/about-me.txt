Introduction

I'm an on-boarding engineer with a passion for challenge. I currently work for Microsoft, helping on-board Office 365 related workloads. I am studying Front End web design and Application development to eventually work freelance. 

It's very important to me to be happy. That's why I'm doing this. I want to be able to learn a variety of web and application languages in order to better myself in the field. I find it very interesting to learn new things, especially if I get to be creative with it. 

 Where I'm From

 I'm from Dallas, Texas. If you ask me, it's the best Dallas. I've grown up there and have lived in and around the entire city. 

 I didn't go to college because I worked full time and, well, couldn't afford it. It's been a tough road, but I'm here now, learning and growing with my career. 

More About Me

Favorite hobbies?
Too many. I have a passion for theatre and am constantly on stage or trying to get there. After that, television, movies and comics!

Dream job?
To be on stage or in front of a camera for the rest of my life. Not literally, that's just ridiculous. Just when I'm awake, mostly.

Experience?
I've been in IT for over 10 years. I started working in Geek Squad while finishing up high school. I moved up through the years and have primarily been working with MSPs delivering customer support at the server administrator level. 

Favorite TV Show?
The Walking Dead. Enough said. 

Favorite Book?
The Walking Dead Graphic Novel series. (What? I like The Walking Dead.)
