      <h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
      <p class="bodytext">I'm an on-boarding engineer with a passion for challenge. I currently work for Microsoft, helping on-board Office 365 related workloads. I am studying Front End web design and Application development to eventually work freelance.</p>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <p class="bodytext">It's very important to me to be happy. That's why I'm doing this. I want to be able to learn a variety of web and application languages in order to better myself in the field. I find it very interesting to learn new things, especially if I get to
        be creative with it. </p>

      <h1><strong>Where I'm From</strong></h1>
      <p class="bodytext">I'm from Dallas, Texas. If you ask me, it's the best Dallas. I've grown up there and have lived in and around the entire city. I didn't go to college because I worked full time and, well, couldn't afford it. It's been a tough road, but I'm here
        now, learning and growing with my career. </p>
